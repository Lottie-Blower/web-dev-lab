->Description
  In this lab, we set up a web development environment by installing VS Code, Git, and Node.js. We created a basic HTML file (index.html), opened it in a browser, and used Git for version control.
> After initializing a Git repository, we pushed our project to GitHub.
>  Additionally, we practiced Git workflows by creating and updating files, working with branches, merging changes via pull requests, and collaborating with a partner by forking their repository and making contributions.
> Finally, we documented our work through a short video or annotated screenshots.
